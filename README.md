# 🔗 VeriChain - Fake Product Detection Using Blockchain

<p align="center">
  <b>A Blockchain-Based Product Authentication System to Detect Counterfeit Products</b>
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**VeriChain** is a blockchain-based fake product detection system that helps users verify the authenticity of products using QR codes and blockchain technology.

The system allows manufacturers to securely register product details on a blockchain network. Customers can scan the QR code attached to a product and instantly check whether the product is **Genuine** or **Fake**.

Blockchain ensures that product information remains secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Counterfeit products are a major problem in many industries:

- 💊 Pharmaceuticals
- 📱 Electronics
- 👑 Luxury Products
- 🍔 Food Products
- 🚗 Automotive Parts

Traditional verification systems depend on centralized databases that can be modified or manipulated.

Customers often cannot easily identify whether a product is original or counterfeit.

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

VeriChain provides a decentralized product verification system using blockchain.

### The system works as follows:

1. Manufacturer registers product details.
2. A unique serial number is generated for each product.
3. Product information is stored in a blockchain smart contract.
4. A QR code containing the serial number is generated.
5. Customer scans the QR code.
6. The system verifies product details from blockchain.
7. The result is displayed:

✅ Genuine Product  
❌ Fake Product
